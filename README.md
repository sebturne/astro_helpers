# astro_highlights
Just a small collection of scripts and functions I wrote during my time as an astrophysicist.

`astro_helpers.py` contains a series of helper functions I wrote to conduct my analyses.

Plots/E5_stamp.png is an example of a plot that was made using `PS()`.

Further example plots pending...

`hlr_snippet.py` is a pedagogical script I wrote to demonstrate the calculation of various 
cosmological distance measures from GAMA survey redshifts in a 737 cosmology.
